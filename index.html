      <h1>WHAT THIS PAGE IS ABOUT</h1>
      <p><strong> A new way to look at the peoples motivations:
        DREAM CARREER:</strong></p>
      <p> Computer forensics is the application of investigation and analysis techniques to gather and preserve evidence from a particular computing device in a way that is suitable for presentation in a court of law. The goal of computer forensics is to
        perform a structured investigation while maintaining a documented chain of evidence to find out exactly what happened on a computing device and who was responsible for it. Forensic investigators typically follow a standard set of procedures: After
        physically isolating the device in question to make sure it cannot be accidentally contaminated, investigators make a digital copy of the device's storage media. Once the original media has been copied, it is locked in a safe or other secure facility
        to maintain its pristine condition. All investigation is done on the digital copy. Investigators use a variety of techniques and proprietary software forensic applications to examine the copy, searching hidden folders and unallocated disk space
        for copies of deleted, encrypted, or damaged files. Any evidence found on the digital copy is carefully documented in a "finding report" and verified with the original in preparation for legal proceedings that involve discovery, depositions, or
        actual litigation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>
        YOU LIKE/HOBBIES:</strong></p>
      <p> I like to draw/ sketch anything I see, I've been sketching since a very young age I have always liked it I had a thing for the small details in example bugs, texture, petals small lines, very small details not many people pay close attention to.
        I like puzzles, word-search, music (dancing). Reading and problem solving has always been something I have also really liked.
      </p>
      <p><strong>THE DAILY-DRIVE:</strong> Ambition Money Independence- To feel in charge of your own life Security- job security, financial security, peace of mind Status/Power/Prestige Self-esteem/The good feeling you get after getting the task done Opportunity
        to improve, to grow and become more capable. Recognition and respect from others after a job well done. Making a difference/ the feeling you get inside You are competitive/ you have to feel that you are gaining ground and winning every time. You
        have a point to prove
